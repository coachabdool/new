            <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top:30px">I found a way...</h2>
            <div class="five columns">
                <p>It was the most depressing period of my life, not only because of the financial crises I landed
                    myself in, but also because I had lost almost everything including my now ex-girlfriend who left me
                    because I was down and dead ass broke.



                    My name is Abdulrahman Shuaib but people prefer to call me Coach Abdool.



                    It started majorly during the covid-19 period, I landed myself in debt of over 5M from one of my
                    failed businesses and in the process of trying to recover my investors money of the failed business,
                    I lost all my personal savings of close to 2M in forex, and from trying to invest in various online
                    schemes where you bring some money and gets doubled after 48hrs.



                    I was really desperate..



                    I was served a court letter. Plus four of my angry investors came together and later got me
                    hand-cuffed, arrested and kept me in the police cell for close to two days.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="six columns">
                <p>Suicidal thoughts came to mind multiple times but the MAJOR reason I didn't do something that stupid
                    was because I believed in the Supreme Being and I was super scared of going to hell...LOL



                    I used to think things like this only happen in Nigeria movies until it all happened to me.



                    After thinking about my mum at home who I was trying to give a better life, I finally made a firm
                    decision to stop meditating on my problems and think of a real solution to the problem I had created
                    as I had very limited time.



                    I knew getting a job was out of it- which company would hire an undergraduate like me barely trying
                    to survive with little to no valuable skill. And even if I did get a job of #100,000 per month which
                    would have been extremely difficult, how many years would I have to work to pay a debt of over 5M I
                    landed myself in from the failed business, and that's assuming I didn't spend any money from my
                    monthly salary.



                    My transformation and break through started when I chatted up a friend who later showed and taught
                    me a NO-FAIL online business model you will be learning shortly..</p>

        <h5 style="text-align:center; font-size: xx-large;"><b>Here is what i did and how it works (The three step Strategy)</b></h5>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="four columns">
                
                    <h6><b>Firstly Pick something to sell (Preferably a hot product)</b></h6>
                
                <p>
                    Affiliate marketing is just like being a car agent, where you sell a car that isn't your own and you
                    get paid a commission when someone pays for the car through you. But the unique benefit about
                    AFFIILIATE MARKETING is that it can comfortably be done from the comfort of your bed, amazing right
                    ??



                    What I did was to join an online platform where I simply recommend or talk about other persons'
                    product and when people buy, I instantly get paid a commission of 20k -30k.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You just need to sell 10 of it to make 200k - 300k monthly. And in the month of December alone, I
                    easily sold close to 30 with a NO-FAIL secret strategy I learnt in no-time which you would learn
                    shortly in the masterclass.



                    <strong>Note:- It is very important you choose a hot product{a product that people want to buy and
                        will
                        easily sell), I will be telling you why shortly.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="four columns">
                <h6><b>Secondly, Find An Easy Way To Attract people That Will Buy The Product</b></h6>
                <p>
                    For this, I implemented the easy system that I also learnt in no-time that easily attracted the
                    exact kind of people that bought the product after I placed it in strategic locations online.



                    Don't worry if you don't really understand this part, you will be shown in the masterclass. I will
                    show you how I learnt how to easily attract people that bought the product, people that will beg you
                    to take their money in exchange for the product you promote.



                    This is by far the easiest step of the three steps.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="four columns">
                <h6><b>Lastly, create a system in place that makes people buy whether you are online or not</b></h6>
                
                <p>
                    Now, this is why you need to sell a hot product. A product that people want to buy and will sell
                    easily.



                    Because selling a product that people already want to buy reduces stress and makes the system you
                    will set with just your smart phone easy.



                    Setting a good system is important to making lots of money very fast which is why I have created a
                    masterclass that takes you by hand and reveal to you how I started from scratch and how you will
                    implement the exact same strategy with ONLY your smartphone.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>This simple strategy will work for you even if:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have Zero Experience about selling online</li>
                    <li>You dont have a laptop as your smartphone is morethan enough</li>
                    <li>You are new to the online space and dont understand how the whole online thing works</li>
